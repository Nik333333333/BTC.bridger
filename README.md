## <sup>Simple script to bridge BTC.b</sup>

## <sup>Supported chains: Arbitrum, Optimism, AvaxC, Polygon, BSC.</sup>

### <sup>***❗You need to have Python 3.10+ installed❗***</sup>


  1. You must already have a BTC.b token on your balance in any of the networks.

  2. **Clone repository** to yours system.

> Open your development environment, such as VSCode or Pycharm. Select the option to clone repo by link and paste the link to this repo.

  3. Open terminal in the same folder as main.py and run this commands:

```
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install web3
```

  4. In the **main.py** file, on **line 156* inside the list, create a transaction to suit your needs. You can find an example of how to do this there as well.
     The script will match all the BTC.b tokens that are on the balance, so you do not need to specify the number. Also, there is no slippage.
     
   > Put your private keys in private_keys.txt

  5. Now you're ready to start:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
